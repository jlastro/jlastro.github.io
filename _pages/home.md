### Welcome!

I am an astronomer at [Steward
Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/), [University of
Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/) and a member of the JWST/MIRI Science Team.
I study supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and galaxies across the cosmic time
with a focus on their infrared properties. 


Unravelling the mysteries of SMBHs and their relationship with galaxies is a
major mission in extragalactic astronomy. How do SMBH influence galaxy
formation and evolution? What are the mechanisms behind their growth and
interactions with surrounding matter? Addressing these questions requires a complete 
census of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies with the
reasonable constraints on their properties. However, the existence of large
amount of dust makes many systems obscured and greatly complicates the
interpretations of the observed properties.

Unlike many astronomers who have been annoyed by dust, I take advantage of its
IR emission to search and characterize AGN and their host systems with the
combination of various data and techniques across the electromagnetic spectrum.
This includes multi-wavelength diagnostics from deep X-ray, optical, IR and
radio surveys to search for obscured AGNs across cosmic time, comparative
spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of the unresolved multi-band
UV-to-submm photometry measurements of low-z objects and high-z ones to obtain
insights on the AGN dusty environment, optical to near-IR time variability and
dust reverberation mapping to probe the very inner structures of the AGN torus.
I also conduct image morphological study, optical--to--mid-IR integral field
unit (IFU) and spectroscopic observations of AGN and galaxies near and far with
various ground- and space-based telescopes. Sometimes I even do numerical
simulations and run complicated models on supercomputers to explain the observations.

I grew up in an under-developed [city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xining)
with low light polution in western China and have been interested in astronomy
since I was a child.  Today I still enjoy stargazing once in a while. In
particular, I am [an eclipse
chaser](https://www.eclipse-chaser-log.com/eclipse-log/336) and [conduct
astrophotography](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220601.html).  Besides watching
the sky, I am also a fan of drawing & painting (both paper and digital),
running (marathon races included), anime and sci-fi. More about these
non-work-related things can be checked in [personal](/personal) page.
